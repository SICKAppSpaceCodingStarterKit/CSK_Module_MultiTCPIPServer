# CSK_Module_MultiTCPIPServer

Module to provide an easy access to TCP/IP server functionality.

## How to Run

The app includes an intuitive GUI to setup communication with IOLink device.  
For further information check out the [documentation](https://raw.githack.com/SICKAppSpaceCodingStarterKit/CSK_Module_MultiTCPIPServer/main/docu/CSK_Module_MultiTCPIPServer.html) in the folder "docu".

## Known issues

In case of using the SICK AppEngine (SAE) please keep in mind for selecting the ethernet interface, neither all selectable interfaces are available nor coincide with the name of the operating system.

### Generic settings

![plot](./docu/media/genericSettings.png)

1. Select ethernet interface and port that the server will listen to. Server must be restarted to apply the new settings
2. Set framings for received and transmitted data. Server must be restarted to apply the new settings
3. Set advanced settings of the server. Server must be restarted to apply the new settings
4. Event and function for data forwarding from/to all connected clients are shown here
5. Table with connected clients
6. Check the latest received/send payload and IP address it was received/send from/to
7. Input field to test sending data to all clients

Info: Server must be restarted to apply new settings...  

### Forward events
It is possible to register to events provided by other modules to forward their results / content via TCP/IP.  
1. Select if the content should be forwarded only for specific clients (defined by a client broadcast list, see in next chapters)
2. Set the event to register
3. Add / delete registration to event

### Client whitelists
Whitelists can be used to filter for data of specific data sources. It is possible to set an IP filter for each created whitelist.  
1. Create, delete and select the whitelist
2. Event to register for forwarded data from the selected whitelist is shown here
3. Add IP addresses to whitelist here

### Client broadcasts
Broadcasts can be used to send data only to specific clients. It is possible to set individual IP filter for each created broadcast.  
1. Create, delete and select the broadcasts
2. Function to call to send data for the selected broadcast is shown here
3. Add IP addresses to the broadcast here
4. Input field to test sending data via the selected broadcast

This module is part of the SICK AppSpace Coding Starter Kit developing approach.  
It is programmed in an object-oriented way. Some of the modules use kind of "classes" in Lua to make it possible to reuse code / classes in other projects.  
In general, it is not neccessary to code this way, but the architecture of this app can serve as a sample to be used especially for bigger projects and to make it easier to share code.  
Please check the [documentation](https://github.com/SICKAppSpaceCodingStarterKit/.github/blob/main/docu/SICKAppSpaceCodingStarterKit_Documentation.md) of CSK for further information.
